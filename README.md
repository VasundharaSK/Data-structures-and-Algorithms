Data Structure and Why We Study Them
Data structures are different from the primitive data types, but they are similar to them in the sense that it holds (structures) same data into certain predefined manners.

When we study data structure and algorithm, we are talking (and concern) about space (RAM) and processing (CPU) efficiency. Both processing power and memory are finite. So we need to keep things optimized so that it takes the least amount of space and processing time. You wonâ€™t want your Lambda function to be running forever, would you? You would want it to take the least amount of time and take the least amount of space, right?
